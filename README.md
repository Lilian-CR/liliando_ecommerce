# LILIANDO E-Commerce

## Overview
LILIANDO is a fully responsive and dynamic e-commerce web application built as part of the Full-Stack Bootcamp at ReDI School (Spring 2025). Developed by Lilian Rodrigues and showcases streetwear fashion & culture. The project is a modern React/Vite application featuring dynamic product rendering, category filters, localStorage-based cart state, and a smooth user experience using Tailwind CSS.

This project is the continuation of Lilian Rodrigues’ first-ever HTML/CSS website, built in June 2024 at ReDI School. It now evolves into a modern, React-powered experience.
